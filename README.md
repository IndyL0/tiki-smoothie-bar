## 📖 How to Play

### 1. Master the Recipe
At the top of the screen, you'll see **Today's Special**. Every smoothie has a specific list of fruits. Catch only what you need! Once an ingredient is gathered, it will be crossed off the list.

### 2. Build Your Streak
Accuracy is rewarded! Every correct fruit you catch increases your **Combo Multiplier**.

### 3. Avoid the Gross Stuff
The rafters are a bit messy. If you catch any of these, your combo resets and you lose a life:
* 🧦 Stinky Socks
* 🧼 Soapy Suds
* 🪲 Crunchy Beetles
* 👟 Old Sneakers
* 🐟 Fishy Fizz
* 🔋 Battery Acid

**Three strikes and the bar is closed!**
